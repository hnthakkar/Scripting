Usage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...
Search for PATTERN in each FILE or standard input.
PATTERN is, by default, a basic regular expression (BRE).
Example: grep -i 'hello world' menu.h main.c

Regexp selection and interpretation:
  -E, --extended-regexp     PATTERN is an extended regular expression (ERE)
  -F, --fixed-strings       PATTERN is a set of newline-separated fixed strings
  -G, --basic-regexp        PATTERN is a basic regular expression (BRE)
  -P, --perl-regexp         PATTERN is a Perl regular expression
  -e, --regexp=PATTERN      use PATTERN for matching
  -f, --file=FILE           obtain PATTERN from FILE
  -i, --ignore-case         ignore case distinctions
  -w, --word-regexp         force PATTERN to match only whole words
  -x, --line-regexp         force PATTERN to match only whole lines
  -z, --null-data           a data line ends in 0 byte, not newline

Miscellaneous:
  -s, --no-messages         suppress error messages
  -v, --invert-match        select non-matching lines
  -V, --version             print version information and exit
      --help                display this help and exit
      --mmap                deprecated no-op; evokes a warning

Output control:
  -m, --max-count=NUM       stop after NUM matches
  -b, --byte-offset         print the byte offset with output lines
  -n, --line-number         print line number with output lines
      --line-buffered       flush output on every line
  -H, --with-filename       print the file name for each match
  -h, --no-filename         suppress the file name prefix on output
      --label=LABEL         use LABEL as the standard input file name prefix
  -o, --only-matching       show only the part of a line matching PATTERN
  -q, --quiet, --silent     suppress all normal output
      --binary-files=TYPE   assume that binary files are TYPE;
                            TYPE is 'binary', 'text', or 'without-match'
  -a, --text                equivalent to --binary-files=text
  -I                        equivalent to --binary-files=without-match
  -d, --directories=ACTION  how to handle directories;
                            ACTION is 'read', 'recurse', or 'skip'
  -D, --devices=ACTION      how to handle devices, FIFOs and sockets;
                            ACTION is 'read' or 'skip'
  -r, --recursive           like --directories=recurse
  -R, --dereference-recursive  likewise, but follow all symlinks
      --include=FILE_PATTERN  search only files that match FILE_PATTERN
      --exclude=FILE_PATTERN  skip files and directories matching FILE_PATTERN
      --exclude-from=FILE   skip files matching any file pattern from FILE
      --exclude-dir=PATTERN  directories that match PATTERN will be skipped.
  -L, --files-without-match  print only names of FILEs containing no match
  -l, --files-with-matches  print only names of FILEs containing matches
  -c, --count               print only a count of matching lines per FILE
  -T, --initial-tab         make tabs line up (if needed)
  -Z, --null                print 0 byte after FILE name

Context control:
  -B, --before-context=NUM  print NUM lines of leading context
  -A, --after-context=NUM   print NUM lines of trailing context
  -C, --context=NUM         print NUM lines of output context
  -NUM                      same as --context=NUM
      --color[=WHEN],
      --colour[=WHEN]       use markers to highlight the matching strings;
                            WHEN is 'always', 'never', or 'auto'
  -U, --binary              do not strip CR characters at EOL (MSDOS/Windows)
  -u, --unix-byte-offsets   report offsets as if CRs were not there
                            (MSDOS/Windows)

'egrep' means 'grep -E'.  'fgrep' means 'grep -F'.
Direct invocation as either 'egrep' or 'fgrep' is deprecated.
When FILE is -, read standard input.  With no FILE, read . if a command-line
-r is given, - otherwise.  If fewer than two FILEs are given, assume -h.
Exit status is 0 if any line is selected, 1 otherwise;
if any error occurs and -q is not given, the exit status is 2.

[1mNAME[0m[m
       find - search for files in a directory hierarchy[m
[m
[1mSYNOPSIS[0m[m
       [1mfind[0m [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [path...] [expression][m
[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       This  manual  page documents the GNU version of [1mfind[0m.  GNU [1mfind[0m searches the directory tree rooted at each given file name by evaluating[m
       the given expression from left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is  known  (the[m
       left hand side is false for [4mand[24m operations, true for [4mor[24m), at which point [1mfind[0m moves on to the next file name.[m
[m
       If  you  are  using  [1mfind[0m  in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to search directories that are[m
       writable by other users), you should read the "Security Considerations" chapter of the findutils documentation, which is called  [1mFinding[0m[m
       [1mFiles[0m and comes with findutils.   That document also includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it[m
       a more useful source of information.[m
[m
[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       The [1m-H[0m, [1m-L[0m and [1m-P[0m options control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following these are  taken  to  be  names  of[m
       files  or  directories to be examined, up to the first argument that begins with `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any[m
       following arguments are taken to be the expression describing what is to be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current  directory[m
       is used.  If no expression is given, the expression [1m-print[0m is used (but you should probably consider using [1m-print0[0m instead, anyway).[m
[m
       This  manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.  These options control the behaviour of [1mfind[0m but are specified imme‐[m
       diately after the last path name.  The five `real' options [1m-H[0m, [1m-L[0m, [1m-P[0m, [1m-D[0m and [1m-O[0m must appear before the first path name, if at  all.   A[m
       double dash [1m--[0m can also be used to signal that any remaining arguments are not options (though ensuring that all start points begin with[m
       either `./' or `/' is generally safer if you use wildcards in the list of start points).[m
[m
       -P     Never follow symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When [1mfind[0m examines or prints information a file, and the file is  a[m
              symbolic link, the information used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.[m
[m
       -L     Follow  symbolic links.  When [1mfind[0m examines or prints information about files, the information used shall be taken from the prop‐[m
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from the link itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or [1mfind[0m is  unable  to[m
              examine  the  file  to which the link points).  Use of this option implies [1m-noleaf[0m.  If you later use the [1m-P[0m option, [1m-noleaf[0m will[m
              still be in effect.  If [1m-L[0m is in effect and [1mfind[0m discovers a symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the  subdirectory[m
              pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.[m
[m
              When  the  [1m-L[0m option is in effect, the [1m-type[0m predicate will always match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points[m
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is broken).  Using [1m-L[0m causes the [1m-lname[0m and [1m-ilname[0m predicates always to[m

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m[m
       [1mfind[0m [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [path...] [expression][m
[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       This  manual  page documents the GNU version of [1mfind[0m.  GNU [1mfind[0m searches the directory tree rooted at each given file name by evaluating[m
       the given expression from left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is  known  (the[m
       left hand side is false for [4mand[24m operations, true for [4mor[24m), at which point [1mfind[0m moves on to the next file name.[m
[m
       If  you  are  using  [1mfind[0m  in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to search directories that are[m
       writable by other users), you should read the "Security Considerations" chapter of the findutils documentation, which is called  [1mFinding[0m[m
       [1mFiles[0m and comes with findutils.   That document also includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it[m
       a more useful source of information.[m
[m
[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       The [1m-H[0m, [1m-L[0m and [1m-P[0m options control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following these are  taken  to  be  names  of[m
       files  or  directories to be examined, up to the first argument that begins with `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any[m
       following arguments are taken to be the expression describing what is to be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current  directory[m
       is used.  If no expression is given, the expression [1m-print[0m is used (but you should probably consider using [1m-print0[0m instead, anyway).[m
[m
       This  manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.  These options control the behaviour of [1mfind[0m but are specified imme‐[m
       diately after the last path name.  The five `real' options [1m-H[0m, [1m-L[0m, [1m-P[0m, [1m-D[0m and [1m-O[0m must appear before the first path name, if at  all.   A[m
       double dash [1m--[0m can also be used to signal that any remaining arguments are not options (though ensuring that all start points begin with[m
       either `./' or `/' is generally safer if you use wildcards in the list of start points).[m
[m
       -P     Never follow symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When [1mfind[0m examines or prints information a file, and the file is  a[m
              symbolic link, the information used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.[m
[m
       -L     Follow  symbolic links.  When [1mfind[0m examines or prints information about files, the information used shall be taken from the prop‐[m
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from the link itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or [1mfind[0m is  unable  to[m
              examine  the  file  to which the link points).  Use of this option implies [1m-noleaf[0m.  If you later use the [1m-P[0m option, [1m-noleaf[0m will[m
              still be in effect.  If [1m-L[0m is in effect and [1mfind[0m discovers a symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the  subdirectory[m
              pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.[m
[m
              When  the  [1m-L[0m option is in effect, the [1m-type[0m predicate will always match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points[m
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is broken).  Using [1m-L[0m causes the [1m-lname[0m and [1m-ilname[0m predicates always to[m
