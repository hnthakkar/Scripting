			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Lorem Ipsum</b><br>
			<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lorem Ipsum is simply
			dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
			been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
			unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
			specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
			leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It
			was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
			containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
			publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
			Ipsum.
