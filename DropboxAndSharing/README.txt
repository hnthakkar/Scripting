INTRODUCTION
------------
Nothing is useful unless we put it to use. Hence we have identified one common problem that we face in our companies and as a part of this project we propose a solution for the same.

Generally in any company we do not have any shared drives to share files across the Department/Vertical which at times is required, plus admins rights are not given so that we can create shared folders, plus at times network restrictions come in play.

Hence an Internal Dropbox with Filesharing web application. (HTTP packets are not bounded by network rules).
